Abstract

The objective of this work was to analyze, by means of an experiment, if the 
type (positive or negative) and the level (simple or complex) of 
economic-financial information influence the anchoring effect of accountants 
and managers in a process of managerial decision-making. To do so, an 
experimental methodology targeting a sample of 86 Accountants, 68 Managers and 
118 people with different professional activities (control group) was used. 
The results showed, in the first test without differentiation of factors (type 
and level), that about 96% of the participants have the anchoring effect, 
leaning towards minimum and maximum estimates of sales revenue, operating 
expenditure and result. In addition, the ANOVA and the Approximate Permutation 
Test brought significant evidence that the anchoring effect in minimum 
projections can be influenced by the type of information, not being significant 
for anchoring in maximum projections and for the level of information on both 
estimates (minimum and maximum). Finally, the conclusion is that positive 
information increases the anchoring effect and negative information decreases 
the anchoring effect in minimum estimates in relation to the low anchor.
