Abstract

This study aims to analyze the performance of an investment portfolio 
using the Markowitz model, which maximizes the Sharpe ratio from a set 
of assets preselected through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model 
using fundamental indicators in the Brazilian stock market. With an 
accuracy of 61% for the SVM model, the results indicate that 
preselecting assets based on fundamental indicators and subsequently 
optimizing them by maximizing the Sharpe ratio showed a superior return 
and faster recovery after drawdown periods compared to the benchmark 
or SVM (1/n) strategy. These results suggest the relevance of including 
the SVM in the optimization portfolio process.
