Abstract

The dynamic speckle analysis has been done because speckle interference began 
to be evaluated as an important source of information, especially those related 
to biological samples under laser beam. The time history speckle pattern, a 
THSP image, is an approach to analyze, which allows a summary to represent the activity monitored. THSP adoption has compelled the research to evaluate the information and the reliability of its inner pattern. This study presents a statistical approach to analyze the data using white noise tests and 
cross-spectrum analysis. The data analyzed was a set of THSP from animal sperm samples. The evaluation of white noise among lines was conducted using the 
Fischer test over eight THSP and the cross-spectral approach has been conducted 
by comparing the information in each THSP. The results presented that the THSP 
of the sperm did not behave as a white noise in a global evaluation, and 
specifically in the Gaussian white noise test over 4096 lines; only six lines presented the behavior of a white noise pattern. The strong rejection of white 
noise test confirms that the THSP pattern allows reliable information. The 
results obtained with the cross-spectral analysis presented differences between 
lines within the same THSP, showing that the information of an inner pattern 
varies in relation to space, which is against the findings in literature.
