Abstract

**Objective**: The objective was to verify the effect of financial flexibility 
on the value of shares of Brazilian companies during the pandemic 
period caused by COVID-19.

**Background**: Financial flexibility is associated with the ability of 
a company to face financial diffi-culties, but there are still no 
studies in Brazil that show its relationship with the value of 
shares in periods with a shock to companies' revenues.

**Method**: Regression analysis was applied to a cross-section of data 
with 102 companies listed on the Brazil Broad Index (IBRA). Two economic 
periods of the pandemic were considered, the col-lapse, between 2/2/2020 
and 3/23/2020, and the stimulus to the economy, on 3/24/2020.

**Results**: The evidence show that in the period of economic collapse, 
the financial flexibility due to debt capacity proved to be valuable 
for companies, especially for those most affected by COVID-19, which 
had more pronounced reductions in revenues in the first half of 2020. 
We have also ob-served that the level of cash retention had no impact 
on stock returns during the collapse period. On the date of economic 
stimulus, the companies' cash level showed a positive relationship with 
the value of shares, but there were no evidence that this appreciation 
occurred for companies with more affected revenues.

Contributions: This study contributes to the literature by verifying the 
impact of financial flexibil-ity on the value of shares of Brazilian 
companies during two different economic moments of the pandemic, namely: 
the collapse and the stimulus to the economy.
