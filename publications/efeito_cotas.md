Abstract

This study aims identify the determinants of premium for voting rights 
in the Brazilian market. To this end, we developed a dataset consisted 
of 383 companies listed on the Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão (B3) from 2000 
to 2015, to use the fixed effects regressions with panel data models. 
We identified that the average of the premium found for the period 
is 18.07%, however, this value is close to 40.00% in years considered 
of systemic crisis, as occurred in 2008 and 2015. In addition to the 
positive influence of the years of decline in the stock market in the 
value of the premium, the results showed that i) the increase in 
liquidity of shares with voting rights negatively affect the value 
of the premium for control; and ii) the level of liabilities payable 
in relation to assets has an inverted U-shape in relation to the 
voting premium. The study contributes to the literature by verifying 
that a structure of two classes of shares allows the accentuation of 
the premium for voting rights in periods of systematic crisis.
