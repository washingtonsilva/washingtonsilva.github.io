Abstract

We examined the volatility process of the returns of two important Brazilian agricultural commodities, coffee and soy, using ARCH class models. Empirical 
results suggest strong signs of persistence and asymmetry in the volatility of 
both series. Furthermore, the results suggest that the design of policies that 
create, facilitate the access and stimulate the use of market-based hedging 
devices can be proper strategies for such sectors in view of the persistence 
of shocks and the pronounced volatility found for the returns of these 
commodities.
